# Thesis-Project-Emotion-Embeddings
Two experiments testing the effect of training data restriction on the accuracy of StrengthNet (Liu et al., 2021) and Zhu et al. (2019)

The two experiments are separated in their folders. Note that the models based on Zhu et al. (2019) require high amounts of RAM.
